MODULE 1 OBJECTIVES

- describe what a graph is, explain its components, provide examples of its useful applications, and draw each of the different graph types

- represent a graph as an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix and compare and contrast the respective representations

- represent a breadth-first-search of a graph in pseudo-code and recall common applications for its use

- represent a depth-first-search of a graph in pseudo-code and recall common applications for its use
```


### Graphs
* are a set of vertices and edges that connect those vertices
* are collections of data represented by nodes and connections between nodes 

### Components
- nodes/vertices: cities, animals, web pages could be objects in a dataset, represented by nodes/vertices
- edges: connections between vertices, can be bidrectional, how you can get from A to B
- weight: cost to travel across an edge

### Implement a graph by creation of a few different sets
- a set of nodes/vertices 
- a set of edges

### Use cases
- subway system
- github (history of commits and pull requests)
- social network

### Types of Graphs
- directed: can only move in one direction
- undirected: bidirectional 
- cyclic: edges allow you to revisit at least one node/vertices
- acyclic: vertices can only be visited once
