```Module 1 Objectives:

- describe what a graph is, explain its components, provide examples of its useful applications, and draw each of the different graph types

- represent a graph as an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix and compare and contrast the respective representations

- represent a breadth-first-search of a graph in pseudo-code and recall common applications for its use

- represent a depth-first-search of a graph in pseudo-code and recall common applications for its use```

```
### Graphs: 
    - are a set of vertices and edges that connect those vertices
    - are collections of data represented by nodes and connections between nodes 

### Components: 
    - nodes/vertices: cities, animals, web pages could be objects in a dataset, represented by nodes/vertices
    - edges: connections between vertices, can be bidrectional, how you can get from A to B
    - weight: cost to travel across an edge

### Implement a graph by creation of a few different sets
    - a set of nodes/vertices 
    - a set of edges

### Use cases: 
    - subway system
    - github (history of commits and pull requests)
    - social network

### Types of Graphs:
    - directed: can only move in one direction
    - undirected: bidirectional 
    - cyclic: edges allow you to revisit at least one node/vertices
    - acyclic: vertices can only be visited once
